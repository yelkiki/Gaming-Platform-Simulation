# Gaming Platform

## Description

This project is a gaming platform implemented in Python. It includes various features such as player profiles, real-time game updates, social interactions, player statistics, and game analytics. The code is organized into different sections, each representing a component of the gaming platform.

## Components

### Player Data

- Manages player profiles with details like username, email, achievements, inventory, and friend list.

### Game Data

- Stores game information including name, type, current state, and world layout details.

### Game State Data (Real-time Updates)

- Tracks player locations, game events, and dynamic aspects of the game world with timestamps for real-time updates.

### Leaderboard Data

- Maintains separate data for leaderboards, pre-aggregated based on chosen metrics (e.g., points, wins, completion time).

### Social Features

- Implements in-game chat and guild functionalities with chat message history and guild membership information.

### Player Statistics

- Tracks detailed player statistics like combat stats, resource stats, and progression stats.

### Game Analytics

- Tracks data on player behavior, game events, and resource utilization for performance monitoring and game improvement.

## Usage

1. Open the `game.py` file in your preferred text editor.
2. Review the code comments and documentation strings to understand each component's functionality.
3. Modify the code as needed to fit your specific requirements.
4. Run the Python script to execute the gaming platform.

## Configuration

- Adjust configuration settings directly in the `game.py` file to specify database connection details, keyspace names, and other parameters.

## Sample Data

- You will find some sample data that were used to test and debug this architecture and make sure it is working alright
